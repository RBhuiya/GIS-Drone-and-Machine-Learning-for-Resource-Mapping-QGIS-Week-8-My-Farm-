#  🇮🇳 QGIS India's Geospatial Data Project

# 🌍 Project Overview
In Week 8, we moved one step closer to practical real-world applications of Remote Sensing by exploring how to remotely monitor agricultural land using Google Earth Pro, High-Resolution LiDAR, and geo-referenced data.

We created a simulation project titled "My_Farm", where we assumed a paddy field as our area of interest. By integrating geo-tagged polygons and LiDAR-based elevation models, we demonstrated how farmers or agricultural analysts can track crop progress, estimate yield, and assess land conditions — all without physically visiting the site.

# 🎯 Objective
- To understand how Google Earth Pro + LiDAR can be used to remotely monitor farmland. 
- To simulate a paddy field project and analyze it using geo-referenced data.
- To learn how KML files store and share geospatial information.
- To demonstrate the use of Remote Sensing in Smart Agriculture for crop estimation and planning.

# ✨ Key Features
- Creation of a sample agricultural land ("My_Farm") using geo-tagged polygons.
- Use of high-resolution LiDAR data to observe terrain variation.
- Monitoring crop progress using satellite-based imagery and elevation overlays.
- Estimation of crop yield using area calculation + mathematical formulas.
- Hands-on experience with .KML file integration and sharing.

# 🛠️ Project Steps
1. Opened Google Earth Pro and created a folder named "My_Farm" under My Places.
2. Added a Polygon to mark the paddy field boundary and saved it as "My_Farm".
3. Imported High-Resolution LiDAR elevation data into the GIS environment.
4. Analyzed the area with remote tools to monitor crop health, land slope, and growth status.
5. Used basic area measurement + crop density formulas to estimate total yield.
6. Exported the result as a KML file to share and collaborate on the farm data.

# 🧪 Benefits of This Approach
- ✅ Pros:
  -⚡ Faster Analysis of Farm Progress
  - 🚫 No Physical Survey Needed
  - 💰 Lower Cost for Large-Scale Monitoring
  - 📐 Yield Estimation using Mathematical Models
  - 🌐 Easy Sharing of Geo-tagged Info via KML

# 📝 Requirements
- ⬇️ Install Google Earth Pro (Download Free): [Official Website](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/earth/about/versions/#download-pro) (Latest Verson).
- Stable Basic internet connection
- Optional: QGIS or any GIS-compatible software

# ✅ Conclusion
This week’s project shows how modern geospatial tools can empower agriculture through remote monitoring, precision planning, and cost savings. 
By combining Google Earth Pro, LiDAR, and AI, even small farms can be managed with high accuracy and zero field visits — making agriculture smarter, faster, and more efficient.
